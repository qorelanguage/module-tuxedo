tuxedo module for Qore
version 0.1 by Pavel Vozenilek
this README by David nichols

This module provides the ability for Qore programs to use the Tuxedo API.
The original author is unfortunately not working on it anymore.

Requires qore 0.7.0 and Tuxedo headers and libraries to build.

documentation: docs/tuxedo-module-doc.html
(built from docbook sources in docs/docbook)

NOTE: there is no example script at the moment.
because Pavel is not working on this anymore and there is no example script, I don't actually know how well this module works...

The configure script will find out where your qore module directory is found and set this for the install directory.
